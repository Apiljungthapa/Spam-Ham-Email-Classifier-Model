# Spam/Ham Email Classifier Model

This project implements a machine learning model for classifying emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and ham emails, and it uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from the text data.

## Overview

The Spam/Ham Email Classifier Model aims to accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or ham to help users filter out unwanted or potentially harmful messages. The model utilizes supervised learning algorithms and text classification techniques to classify emails based on their content and other features.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data to remove noise, tokenize the text, and extract relevant features.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or neural networks on the labeled email dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into production to classify incoming emails in real-time and integrate it with email clients or spam filters.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the labeled dataset containing examples of spam and ham emails. Ensure that the dataset is properly labeled and split into training and testing sets.

2. **Text Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant characters, and perform tokenization.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings. Transform the text data into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.

4. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed and feature-engineered dataset. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using cross-validation or a separate test set. Calculate evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance and make improvements as necessary.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into production using web frameworks like Flask or Django. Integrate the model with email clients or spam filters to classify incoming emails automatically.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), pandas, NumPy, etc.
